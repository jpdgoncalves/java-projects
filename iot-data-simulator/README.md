# IOT Data Simulator

A small project that currently intends to create a small library that
allows to produce data from various simulated sensors. It is currently 
able to send data through sockets, Kafka and MQTT.

## TODO

- Add an emitter for web sockets.
- Add a base emitter that reads the data from a file.
